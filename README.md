## AWS Amplify React + Vite Portfolio

# Changelog (v1.0, 9/25/24)
## Homepage Refactor

* Added Navigation Bar with the addition of React Router
* Added 5 new typescript pages (About, Contacts, Home, Projects, Resume)

## Router Definition

For our navigation bar, only our component section changes in our app. We don't want to continously refresh the app
through something such as a case statement, so we use a feature of React called React Router (react-router-dom). It enabled us to create a single-page web application without needing
to do the previuously aforementioned.
